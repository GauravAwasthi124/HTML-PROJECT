                Cricket game tour of XI Bofors and Lamgondi area
                
                As such, Lamgaudi area has always been known for its cultural activities, whether it is Ramlila staging or other cultural events, today I remembered those days when I heard that XI Bofors team of Lamgaudi won the cricket competition in Diwali Bhanigram. Took.From the time of cultural events, some games like volleyball used to be organized in the area long ago, but I am probably a witness to the beginning of cricket.I would like to give credit to Pushpendra Shukla Mama ji and Ishwarchand Awasthi Bhai Saab for starting cricket in the region and then to Ganesh Tiwari ji and Swa Devi Tiwari ji in Diwali Bhanigram. After some initial years of cricket, Rajeev Posti Bhai Saab and Prabhat Shukla Bhai Saab's brainchild, this name was "Eleven Bofors", which even after years still seems to be its own team of the region.This was the team of “Soil Lions”. This name was given to this team by a Boda ji, who used to run a tea shop in Nala, because this team kept winning there for three consecutive years.All those players used to win the match by lying down with the soil, even after falling, that's why they were the real lions, the lions of the soil of the sports fields. Today there are resources, there is more understanding of the game, but the passion was there.It was difficult to dismiss the opening pair of Krishna Jugran Bhai and Nitin, everyone liked Krishna's defensive every ball and Nitin's fast play from the first ball.No matter how long a run-up someone takes today, no one will have a run-up like Koso Bhai's (Arun Bajpai). According to the field, no one can play like Anuj Bajpai with equal ability on both sides.Hardly anyone can do accurate bowling like Arun, Anuj and Harish Negi and bowling like Anil (Chuiya). Who can forget Harish Negi's double hat-trick in Lamgoundi.Hardly anyone can do wicket-keeping like Bhaskar Posti, Krishna Bhai and Gulli Bhayona (Virender Posti). Hardly anyone could hit sixes like Bhaskar Posti Bhai, Kapoor Sajwan Bhai and Shushil Trivedi over long on and bowler's head.There are hardly any all-rounders like Anand Sajwan Bhai,<mark> Prakash Awasthi Bhai</mark> and Amarnath Shukla Bhai playing left-handed for the team and Balram Bhai, Gumalaya Bhai (Rameshwar Semwal) fielding at third man.-Semwal</p>
